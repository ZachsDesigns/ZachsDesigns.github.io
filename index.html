					<p>My name is Zach and I'm a self taught graphic designer, illustrator and webdeveloper trying to find a way that I can help people out. As you can see on my website, I have multiple different things. A Downloads page, a Portfolio page, and an Order Forms area. All these pages are for thinggs that I do. I have 2 youtube channels that I try to be as active on as I can. I have a digital <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBX88dD_OA8_7j8eDORwgQA">Graphic Design</a> channel, and a <a href="">Game Design/Programing</a> channel. On my Graphic Design Channel, I do speedarts and vlogs, and on my Game Design channel. I play games, design them, and do programming tutorials for people who wouldlike to learn. My downloads page is used for all the things that I've made for the public to download and use. My Portfolio is where all the art that I've done ends up. Last but certainly not least are my Order Forms. I have 2 so far, one of them is for people to order art from me, and the other is for people to order custom responsive websites for there buisness or personal use.</p>

					<p>If you would like to be a <b>HUGE</b> help in my career. I would love it if you would donate money to my PayPal account. It helps out with all sorts of things. More videos for my viewers. More time for me to program. Money for books and courses for me to take and apply it to my skills. Just so many things, that so little can do helps out. By helping me out, I can help you out with your problems.</p>
